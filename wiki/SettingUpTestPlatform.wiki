#summary How to setup saasta.fi test server on Mac OS X
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Setting up saasta.fi test server =

=== Download and install MAMP ===

http://www.mamp.info/en/download.html

Mount disk image and drag MAMP to Applications.

- Start Applications/MAMP/MAMP.app -- this will start MySQL and Apache automatically

=== Import DB ===
- Download the latest mysql dump from saasta: ~/saasta/backup/<n>/saastafidb.dump.  It's better to use a backup rather than copying from the site, as this will test that backups are working

- Import the DB from the command line (phpMyAdmin doesn't support big DBs):

Create DB:
sudo /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysqladmin -p create saastafi

(passwd=root)

Import DB:

sudo /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql -u root -p saastafi < saastafidb.dump 

Access DB:

sudo /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql -u root -p saastafi

=== Install saasta.fi wordpress from backups ===

*Note:* If you want to update the live saasta.fi server from your SVN repository, see UpdatingLiveServerFromSvn.  You should do this only after you have a working test installation.

Go to the root of your www.saasta.fi backup, and run:

cp -R saasta /Applications/MAMP/htdocs

Edit /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/saasta/wp-config.php and change DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD to the following:

define('DB_USER', 'root');     // Your MySQL username

define('DB_PASSWORD', 'root'); // ...and password

=== Change WordPress URL to localhost ===

Follow these instructions and set the host URL to http://localhost:8888

Note that changing the siteurl is not enough.


=== Check that it all works ===

Browse to url http://localhost:8888/saasta/ and it all just works!
