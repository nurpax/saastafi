== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is this plugin for WordPress 2.5 only? =

In order to ensure the most stability, this plugin is WordPress 2.5 only. The plugin makes extensive use of 2.5 features, so it is not possible to release for an earlier version.

Yes, the last stable version for WP versions 2.1 - 2.5 is:  <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-ajax-edit-comments.v1.1.5.1.zip">1.1.5.1</a>.
