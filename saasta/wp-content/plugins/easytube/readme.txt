EasyTube allows Wordpress users to easily embed YouTube and Google Videos using one simple tag.

== Installation ==

1. Copy easytube.php into your wordpress plugins folder, normally located
   in /wp-content/plugins/

2. Login to Wordpress Admin and activate the plugin


A wordpress player can be embedded in a post using a tag of the following
form:

[youtube:URL]

e.g. [youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb1_h9bguvI]

The URL is the url found on YouTube for a particular video.

You can also set the dimensions:

[youtube:URL WIDTH HEIGHT]

e.g. [youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb1_h9bguvI 300 200]

Same tag format for Google Vidoes but with googlevideo instead of youtube
e.g. [googlevideo:URL]
